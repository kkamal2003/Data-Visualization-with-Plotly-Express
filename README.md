## Task 1: Loading the Data

The dataset is loaded using Plotly Express's built-in function.

## Task 2: Quick Visualizations with Custom Bar Charts

Custom bar charts are created to visualize population trends in Canada over the years.

## Task 3: Plot Life Expectancy vs GDP per Capita

Scatter plots are generated to explore the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita in 2007, with options to color by continent.

## Task 4: Customize Interactive Bubble Charts

Interactive bubble charts are customized to represent life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population for each country in 2007.

## Task 5: Create Interactive Animations and Facet Plots

Animations and facet plots are utilized to visualize how life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population change over the years for different continents.

## Task 6: Represent Geographic Data as Animated Maps

Geographic data is represented as animated choropleth maps, showing life expectancy across countries over the years.

## Task 7: Interactive Line Plots and Area Plots

Interactive line plots and area plots are created to visualize life expectancy and population trends over the years, with options to color by continent and country.

## About the Data: Data Source

The Gapminder dataset contains information on life expectancy, GDP per capita, population, and continent for various countries. The dataset is provided by Plotly Express.
